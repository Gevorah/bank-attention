# bank-attention

Bank Attention is a software for the attention of users in banks, this program in its initial phase allows three options:
1 display priority and general rows
2 Register a shift if you are already in the bank's database or register as a new customer
3 view the database of active and inactive bank users

Likewise, it also allows the user to make a consignment, withdrawal, payment of tax or account cancellation
always giving the option to cancel the action carried out previously.

On the other hand, it allows the bank agent to serve a user in the priority or general row, as the case may be.
You are allowed to sort the information in the database according to 4 criteria

Finally, all these actions can be carried out through a user interface that is very easy on the eyes.
